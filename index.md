## Course description

Number theory is the study of patterns in the set of natural numbers and its arithmetic operations. Like geometry, it is one of the most classical fields in mathematics. In number theory there are many questions which simultaneously have very simple statements and extremely complicated solutions (or no known answer at all). In this course we will aim to explore a variety of different areas of inquiry and problem-solving methods in number theory.

### Anticipated learning outcomes

* Possess and exhibit a working knowledge of linear algebra content
* Read and write proofs in linear algebra
* Explore mathematical questions and appreciate abstract mathematics

### Rough plan

* Weeks 1-3: Vector spaces
* Weeks 4-6: Linear mappings
* Weeks 7-9: Eigenvalues/vectors and orthogonality
* Weeks 10-12: Spectral theory
* Weeks 13-15: Operators, trace, determinant

### Course format

The course will be delivered through synchronous remote class sessions. Each session will include a mixture of student questions on previous material, discussion of new material, and group problem solving.

## Grading

### Attendance and participation 20\%

Please attend remote class sessions, be prepared to ask questions and discuss the material, and collaborate with your peers on group activities. Each session will feature one or more "U-Proov" problem which must be completed collaboratively and submitted with the next homework assignment. You may miss a few sessions without penalty, but additional absences must be documented.

### Homework 80\%

Homework assignments will be given each week and collected the following week.

### What is cheating?

You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers, and you are welcome to use online resources when you are stuck (please reference). But please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly write them in your own words.
